clear all /*or "clear *". Remove all data, value labels, matrices
    scalars, constraints, clusters, stored results, sersets, and Mata functions and objects
    from memory.  They also close all open files and postfiles, clear the class system,
    close any open Graph windows and dialog boxes, drop all programs from memory, and reset
    all timers to zero.*/

capture log close 

log using "$MO_endline_log_files\officersurvey_rename.log", replace text

* We will add this line from time to time if the program takes time to compute or uses a lot of loops
noisily display as text "The date is " as result "--$S_DATE--" as text " and the time is " as result "--$S_TIME--"

* initialize workflow-specific parameters
*	Set overwrite_old_data to 1 if you use the review and correction
*	workflow and allow un-approving of submissions. If you do this,
*	incoming data will overwrite old data, so you won't want to make
*	changes to data in your local .dta file (such changes can be
*	overwritten with each new import).
